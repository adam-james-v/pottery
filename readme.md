# Pottery

Programmatic CAD project for creating pottery-like geometry.

## Usage

Launch a Clojure REPL and load the project. A better usage situation will evolve over time.

## Status

Open experimenting. I want to turn different generative ideas into scripts and/or interactive Client-side Webpages. For now, treat the source as an example for your own CAD hacking!
